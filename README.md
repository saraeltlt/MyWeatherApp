# Weather App

The weather app I built allows users to view the current weather conditions, hourly and daily weather forecasts, and weather alerts for their location using a map search function. I implemented various features such as a location detection system and customizable settings to customize the app to users' preferences. The application was designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with.
